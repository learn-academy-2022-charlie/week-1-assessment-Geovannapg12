# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:  

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Github is the place where you can keep the files and upload them, Git is the tool

  Researched answer:"Git is an open-source tool developers install locally to manage source code, while GitHub is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect and upload or download resources" I still have a hard time trying to describe what Git is, but it is a tool developers use.


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Boolean gives a true of false value so if we use the === which I think is called equality operator it gives a true or false statement, there is also the < > greater than and less than  

  Researched answer: "Relational operators looks for a relationship between two values. A Boolean value is returned. < >"
  "Equality operators compare one value to the other and judge if the values equate to the same thing. ==="
  I was missing the logical operators "&&" "||" and "!"



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: theres the index for the first number or value in a string or the index "i" in loops. A value is the name, number or any information you give to a specific thing.

  Researched answer: "strings have a length property and each character in the string can be accounted for by its placement called an index.""
  // "Each element in the array must be a JavaScript data type. The content of each element is called the value." I did not explain in it in the way I wanted it but I think I was not that wrong.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: to be completely honest I remember this term from the intro but I do not remember exactly what is does. I want to say it has something to do with the string

  Researched answer:" iteration is the process of performing a particular action a certain number of times or until a condition is met. " Well I vas very wrong, it was not about the strings it was about for loops



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: The driver writes the code while sharing the screen with the navigator. The navigator is the one telling the driver what to code. Both should be equally involved in the work, constant communication (explaining why and why not the code doesn't work) and switching places.


  Researched answer:" One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently."



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function takes another function and makes it into an argument or an output.

2. Jest: A testing place where we can see if the JavaScript code is correct, it used for creating running tests. So instead of having to use the terminal and see what we got wrong we can use Jest

3. Object: Consists of two things the key and value, both work as pieces of information that go in the curly braces

4. Method: When a function belongs to an object. So if the value inside is a function then it is method

5. Classes: A function that contain data and behavior, there needs to be different types of keywords to make it a class
